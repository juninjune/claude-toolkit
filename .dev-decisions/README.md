# Development Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), critical issues, and important technical decisions tracking.

## How It Works

This directory captures **significant decisions and issues** that shape the project:
- **ADRs**: Architecture decisions, library choices, design patterns
- **Issues**: Critical bugs, performance problems, security incidents
- **Status tracking**: Active, Deprecated, Superseded decisions

Unlike `.dev-journal/` which logs all work sessions, this directory focuses on **milestone decisions** that have long-term impact.
