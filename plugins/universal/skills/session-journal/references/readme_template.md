# Development Journal

Session-based work log for maintaining context across Claude Code sessions without bloating CLAUDE.md.

## How It Works

Each session is documented in a timestamped file (`YYYYMMDD_HHMM_topic-slug.md`) with:
- Keywords for easy searching (features, modules, issues, domain concepts)
- Summary and context
- What was done and key decisions
- Links to related sessions

Keywords evolve naturally:
- Used 3+ times → Established keywords, prioritized for matching
- Used 1-2 times → Emerging keywords, may fade if not reinforced
- Frequently used keywords help connect related sessions automatically
